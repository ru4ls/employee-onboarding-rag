How to Book a Meeting Room Using Odoo Calendar
==============================================

This guide shows you how to reserve a physical meeting room for your meetings using the Odoo Calendar application.

1. Purpose
----------
To avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure meeting rooms are available when needed, all room bookings must be made through the official calendar system.

2. Procedure
------------
**Step 1: Navigate to the Calendar Module**
From the main Odoo dashboard, click on the "Calendar" application.

**Step 2: Create a New Event**
- Click on the desired date and time slot in the calendar view to create a new event.
- A pop-up window will appear. Click "Edit" to see the full event details.

**Step 3: Fill in Meeting Details**
- **Subject:** Enter a clear title for your meeting (e.g., "Marketing Weekly Sync").
- **Start/End Time:** Adjust the date and time as needed.

**Step 4: Add Attendees (People)**
- In the "Attendees" section, start typing the names of the colleagues you wish to invite. Select them from the list.
- They will receive a calendar invitation via email.

**Step 5: Add the Meeting Room (Resource)**
- This is the most important step for booking the room.
- In the same "Attendees" section, type the name of the meeting room you want to book (e.g., "Meeting Room A", "Boardroom", "Focus Booth 1").
- The meeting rooms are set up as resources that can be invited just like people.

**Step 6: Check for Conflicts and Save**
- Odoo will automatically show if there are any time conflicts with the people or the room you have invited.
- If there are no conflicts, click the "Save" button.
- The meeting room is now officially reserved for your event.

3. Best Practices
-----------------
- **Cancel Promptly:** If your meeting is cancelled or rescheduled, please edit or delete the calendar event immediately to free up the room for others.
- **Be Considerate:** Do not book rooms for longer than necessary.
- **Keep it Tidy:** Leave the meeting room in a clean and orderly state after your meeting.
