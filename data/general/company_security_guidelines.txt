DummyWorX IT Security Best Practices
=====================================

All employees are responsible for protecting the company's data and systems. Adherence to these guidelines is mandatory.

1. Password Policy
------------------
- **Complexity:** Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Uniqueness:** Do not reuse passwords across different systems. Your Odoo password must be unique.
- **Sharing:** Never share your password with anyone, including IT support staff.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA must be enabled on all company accounts where it is available, especially for Odoo and email access.

2. Phishing and Email Security
-----------------------------
- **Be Skeptical:** Treat all unexpected emails with caution, especially those asking for credentials, personal information, or immediate action.
- **Check the Sender:** Verify the sender's email address. Look for subtle misspellings.
- **Do Not Click Links:** Hover over links to see the actual destination URL before clicking. If in doubt, do not click.
- **Report Suspicious Emails:** Use the "Report Phishing" button in your email client or forward the email to it.security@wellaworx.com.

3. Software and Device Usage
----------------------------
- **Approved Software:** Only install software from the approved list provided by the IT department. Installing unauthorized software is prohibited.
- **Company Devices:** Company laptops and phones are for business use. Incidental personal use is permitted but should be minimal.
- **Keep Systems Updated:** Always accept and install system and application updates when prompted. These updates contain critical security patches.

4. Data Handling
----------------
- **Confidential Data:** Do not transfer confidential company data to personal devices or public cloud services (like personal Google Drive or Dropbox).
- **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid accessing sensitive company information while connected to public, unsecured Wi-Fi networks (e.g., at cafes, airports). Use the company VPN if you must.

5. Incident Reporting
---------------------
If you suspect your device has been compromised, you have lost a company device, or you have accidentally clicked on a malicious link, report it to the IT Helpdesk immediately. Prompt reporting is crucial to minimizing potential damage.
