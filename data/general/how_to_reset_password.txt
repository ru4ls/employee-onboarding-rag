How to Reset Your Odoo & Company Password
=========================================

This guide explains the self-service method for resetting your password for Odoo and other integrated company systems.

**Method 1: Self-Service Password Reset (Preferred)**

Use this method if you have forgotten your password but have not been locked out of your account.

**Step 1: Go to the Odoo Login Page**
Navigate to the main Odoo login screen.

**Step 2: Find the "Reset Password" Link**
Below the password field, click on the "Reset Password?" link.

**Step 3: Enter Your Company Email**
You will be taken to a new page. Enter your official DummyWorX email address (e.g., user.name@wellaworx.com) and click "Reset Password".

**Step 4: Check Your Email**
- The system will send a password reset link to your email inbox.
- This link is only valid for a short period of time (typically 1 hour).
- If you do not see the email, check your Spam or Junk folder.

**Step 5: Create a New Password**
- Click the link in the email.
- You will be directed to a secure page where you can enter and confirm your new password.
- Remember to follow the company password policy (at least 12 characters, mix of cases, numbers, and symbols).

**Method 2: Contacting IT Support**

Use this method only if the self-service reset fails or if your account has been locked due to too many failed login attempts.

- Email it.support@wellaworx.com from your personal email if you cannot access your company account.
- State your full name and username.
- IT Support will initiate a manual reset process and will contact you with further instructions.

**Important Security Note:** The IT department will NEVER ask you for your old or new password. Do not share your password with anyone.
