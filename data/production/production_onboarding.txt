Production Department Onboarding Guide
======================================

Welcome to the Production Department at DummyWorX. This guide covers your role and how we manage production using Odoo ERP to ensure efficiency, quality, and traceability.

1. Department Overview
------------------------
The Production Department is responsible for planning, manufacturing, and ensuring the quality of products. We collaborate closely with Warehouse, Procurement, and Quality Control teams to maintain smooth operations.

2. Key Responsibilities
-------------------------
- Execute Manufacturing Orders (MOs) accurately and on time.
- Monitor production stages and report any delays or issues immediately.
- Adhere to all quality control and safety standards.
- Perform routine maintenance on workstations and equipment.
- Optimize material usage to minimize scrap and waste.

3. Daily Workflow Using Odoo ERP
--------------------------------
Your work is centered in the Odoo **Manufacturing** module.

**a. Review Manufacturing Orders (MOs):**
At the start of your shift, check the MOs assigned to your work center. Each MO details the product, quantity, Bill of Materials (BoM), and routing steps.

**b. Execute Production Steps:**
- Click "Start" on an MO when materials are ready.
- Follow the defined work order steps precisely.
- Consume components and record progress in real-time using your workstation's terminal.
- Mark stages as completed to move the MO to the next work center.

**c. Quality Checks:**
Some stages will trigger a mandatory Quality Check. You must navigate to the **Quality** module, perform the required tests, and record the results as "Pass" or "Fail". For detailed procedures, refer to the **"quality_control_sop.txt"** document.

**d. Maintenance Reports:**
If equipment malfunctions, create a Maintenance Request immediately in the **Maintenance** module.

**f. End of Shift:**
Mark all completed MOs, clean your workstation, and submit your shift report via the Odoo Notes app.

4. Core Manufacturing KPIs
-----------------------
- **On-Time Production Rate:** Percentage of orders completed by the scheduled date.
- **Rework & Scrap Rate:** Percentage of products requiring rework or being scrapped.
- **Equipment Downtime:** Total hours of unscheduled equipment stoppage.
- **Cycle Time:** The average time to complete one unit.

5. Safety Guidelines
