Production Department Onboarding Guide
======================================

Welcome to the Production Department at DummyWorX. This guide covers your role and how we manage production using Odoo ERP to ensure efficiency, quality, and traceability.

1. Department Overview
------------------------
The Production Department is responsible for planning, manufacturing, and ensuring the quality of products. We collaborate closely with Warehouse, Procurement, and Quality Control teams to maintain smooth operations.

2. Workflow
--------------------------------
Your work is centered in the Odoo **Manufacturing** module.

**a. Review Manufacturing Orders (MOs):**
At the start of your shift, check the MOs assigned to your work center. Each MO details the product, quantity, Bill of Materials (BoM), and routing steps.

**b. Execute Production Steps:**
- Click "Start" on an MO when materials are ready.
- Follow the defined work order steps precisely.
- Consume components and record progress in real-time using your workstation's terminal.
- Mark stages as completed to move the MO to the next work center.

**c. Quality Checks:**
Some stages will trigger a mandatory Quality Check. You must navigate to the **Quality** module, perform the required tests, and record the results as "Pass" or "Fail". For detailed procedures, refer to the **"quality_control_sop.txt"** document.

**d. Maintenance Reports:**
If equipment malfunctions, create a Maintenance Request immediately in the **Maintenance** module.

**f. End of Shift:**
Mark all completed MOs, clean your workstation, and submit your shift report via the Odoo Notes app.

3. Safety Guidelines
---------------------
- **Physical Safety:** Always wear required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): gloves, helmet, safety shoes. Do not operate unfamiliar machines without certified training. Report unsafe conditions immediately.
- **Digital Security:** Your Odoo account is your responsibility. For password and data security rules, refer to the main **"company_security_guidelines.txt"**.
