IT Department Onboarding Guide
==============================

Welcome to the IT Department at DummyWorX. This guide outlines our department's purpose, key procedures, and how we use Odoo ERP to provide efficient and secure technical support to the entire company.

1. Department Overview
----------------------
The IT Department is the backbone of the company's technology infrastructure. We are responsible for managing all hardware, software, network systems, and providing technical support to ensure all employees can work productively and securely.

2. Workflow
----------------------------
Odoo is central to our support and administrative tasks.

**a. Ticket Management (Helpdesk Module):**
- The **Odoo Helpdesk** is your primary workspace. All user requests must come through this system.
- Tickets are assigned to stages (New, In Progress, Solved, Cancelled).
- You are responsible for picking up new tickets, communicating with the user via the ticket's chatter, and documenting your solution before closing the ticket.
- Always aim to meet the SLAs defined for each ticket priority.

**b. Employee Onboarding (Employees Module):**
- When HR registers a new employee, a task is created for IT.
- Your responsibilities include preparing their laptop, creating their user accounts, and ensuring they have access to their department's required resources on their first day.

**c. Documentation (Documents Module):**
- Our internal IT procedures, SOPs, and network diagrams are stored in the Odoo **Documents** app, within the "IT Knowledge Base" folder.
- You are expected to contribute to and help maintain this documentation.

4. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
----------------------------------
Our performance is measured by our ability to respond to and resolve issues in a timely manner.
- **P1 - Critical (System-wide outage):** 15-minute response, 4-hour resolution.
- **P2 - High (Individual unable to work):** 30-minute response, 8-hour resolution.
- **P3 - Normal (General inquiry, non-critical issue):** 4-hour response, 2-day resolution.

5. Common Issues & Reporting
----------------------------
| Issue                          | How to Instruct User to Report                 |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Cannot log in / Forgot Password| Guide them to "how_to_reset_password.txt" first, then escalate to a ticket. |
| VPN connection issue           | Direct them to "how_to_connect_vpn.txt" first, then escalate to a ticket. |
| Software request               | Submit a ticket in Odoo Helpdesk with manager approval attached. |
| Hardware malfunction (laptop, mouse) | Submit a ticket with the device's asset tag number. |

Welcome to the team! Your work is critical to empowering every employee at DummyWorX to do their best work.
